# Magic8 Languages

**The en.json file is updated every time a feature's multilingual support is added/edited. Review updates [here](https://github.com/OfficialMagic8/Languages/commits/master/languages/en.json) to add the same content to your language file.**

**Want to collaborate? Add your own language with all translations and we will add it to the available translations!**

### Instructions
- Create a fork of the [en.json](https://github.com/Fyrlex/Magic8-Languages/blob/master/languages/en.json) file.
- Please make sure you are familiar with [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) format, [arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), [objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects) and [strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String).
- Please make sure you understand all of [Markdown](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-)
- Translate the English to your fluently known language

### Rules
- Do not edit the contents of the placeholders "{EXAMPLE}". Move them accordingly for grammar purposes. Please contact Fyrlex#2740 if you are not sure what a placeholder means.
- Do **NOT** use a translating service
- Do **NOT** change the meaning of translations. We will review your submission(s).

### Perks
- Language Contributor Role in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/bUUggyCjvp)
- Free Triple Package
- Advertisement on the Magic8 bot or in the #sponors channel
- Credit on the info command for the language
- Utmost respect from the developers
- Possibly more

Please only translate files to your known language if you are already **fluent** in English. This way, you can understand the grammar and make proper changes.

There are still quite a few commands that do not support translations. It is tedious work that will be done when the developers have the time to do so.
