# Magic8 Languages

The developers of Magic8 have spent the past few weeks moving all messages into this repository. In addition, Magic8 directly pulls its languages from here and works pretty fast. Come join the project and help translate Magic8!

*Please note that we are **not** looking for complete translations! Although we'd greatly appreciate that, we aren't rushing you to complete the entire English file translated in one night.*

Please only translate files to your known language if you are already **somewhat fluent** in English. This way, you can understand the grammar and make proper changes. If you ever have a question about a word or phrase, do not hesitate to contact support.

There are still quite a few commands that do not support translations. It is tedious work that will be done when the developers have the time to do so.
