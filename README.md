# Magic8 Languages

**The en.json file is updated every time a feature's multilingual support is added/edited. Review updates [here](https://github.com/Fyrlex/Magic8/commits/master/languages) to add the same content to your language file.**

**Want to collaborate? Add your own language with all translations and we will add it to the available translations!**
- Copy the en.json file (this file gets updated when new features are added or an error is fixed!)
- Translate all the English to your known language
- Do not edit the contents of the placeholders ({EXAMPLE}). Move them accordingly for grammar purposes.
- Do **NOT** use a translating service
- Do **NOT** change the meaning of translations. We will review your submission(s).

Please only translate files to your known language if you are already **fluent** in English. This way, you can understand the grammar and make proper changes.
